# Health-and-fitness-tracking-azure-project
This project is a health and fitness tracking application built on Microsoft Azure. It empowers users to monitor their progress towards their health and fitness goals by providing a comprehensive platform for data collection, analysis, and visualization. For this project microsoft azure resources are used.



**Data Source**

This dataset was taken from kaggle which was generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. Individual reports can be parsed by export session ID (column A) or timestamp (column B). Variation between output represents use of different types of Fitbit trackers and individual tracking behaviors / preferences.

Only the data that is required for the analysis is selected and taken. Those files are uploaded under the file "data/raw-data" 



**Data Ingestion**


Step 1: Here we upload the files first to the github
Step 2: Create a Azure storage account in the azure portal
Step 3: Create a new container and create two files "raw-data" and "transform-data"
Step 4: Create a data factory and add data through pipeline
Step 5: Data can be added using the raw page of the data from the github and choose the correct file from the storage account
Step 6: Once the pipeline is debugged the files we automatically appear in the container



**Data Transformation**


Step 1: Create an Azure Databricks Workspace
Step 2: Launch Workspace
Step 3: Create a compute using the compute tab
Step 4: Create an Azure App Registration and collect the "client ID", "tenant id", and :Secret id".
Step 5: Use the "code_transform.py" in the workspace by changing the above key
step 6: The transformed data will be visible in the the storage container.(The transformed files are given in the path "data/transform-data")



**Data Visualization**


The transformed data is to analyse and vizualize the data
The dashboard was originally created in the microsoft power bi
This is connected to the the azure devops for the applications
The visualizations are given below:



**Home Page:**

The image is a data dashboard for health and fitness information. It displays information for a user named Rose. Dates are listed along the bottom axis, with corresponding values for sleep, weight, and activity. There are multiple activity categories including very active, moderately active, and lightly active. The majority of Rose’s activity falls under lightly active. Sleep data is displayed in blue with peaks up to 8,000 steps. Weight data is displayed in green with a reading of 200 kg. There is also a BMI of 25.19.

**Daily Activity Page:**

The image is a screenshot of a dashboard showing daily activity. It displays a bar graph for steps, calories burned, and distance traveled. Text at the top of the image identifies it as “Daily Activity”.

Below the graph is a table with the user ID, highest step count, highest calorie count, and furthest distance traveled recorded. It shows the user’s ID as 940, with a highest daily step count of 36,019, most calories burned at 4,900, and farthest distance traveled of 101.68 kilometers.

**Hourly Activity Page:**


The image is a screenshot of a health and fitness dashboard. It displays a graph of a person's hourly activity for multiple days. The x-axis shows dates, while the y-axis shows steps. There are colored sections within the graph that categorize activity intensity throughout the day.

Text at the top of the image identifies it as "Hourly Activity".

A table below the graph shows details like highest step count, highest calorie count, and highest intensity for the user identified by ID 940. It also shows breakdowns by activity hour including total steps, sedentary minutes, and calories burned.

**Minutely Activity Page**

The image is a screenshot of a health and fitness dashboard titled "Minutely Activity". It displays data for a user identified by ID 940. Dates are listed along the bottom axis, with corresponding values for average steps, calories burned, and activity intensity.

The data appears to cover a two-month period, but specific dates and values are blurred out. However, the legend indicates that the activity intensity is measured in calories.

Overall, the dashboard seems to show users detailed information about their activity levels throughout the day.
